## Capacitors

### Energy Stored
The energy stored by a capacitor of capacitance, C with a voltage, v
$$ E = \frac{1}{2} C V^2$$
- $C$ = Capacitance, Farads, F
- $V$ = Voltage, Volts, V
  
  
### Capacitor Equation
The ratio of charge to voltage.
$$ C = \frac{Q}{V} $$
- $C$ = Capacitance, Farads, F
- $V$ = Voltage, Volts, V
- $Q$ = Charge, Coulombs, C
