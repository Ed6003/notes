# Integration

## Integration by Parts

When an integral is a product of two functions (ie $\int e^x \sin x$), it can be integrated by parts:

$$\int u \frac{dv}{dx} \,dx = uv - \int b \frac{du}{dx} \,dx$$

(see also the DI method)

## Improper Integrals

An integral is improper if either

- One of its limits is infinity
- The function is not defined for any point within the interval (bounds inclusive)

To evaluate these integrals, replace the dodgy boundwith a variable $t$, evaluate the integral in terms of the variable, and then take the limit as the variable tends towards the bound.

$$\int_a^{\infty} f(x) \, dx = \lim_{t \to \infty} \int_a^t f(x) \, dx$$

Where functions are not continuous over the interval, may need to split the function into two integrals. For example, if $f(x)$ is not continuous at $x = c$ where $a < c <b$, then:
$$\int_a^b f(x) \,dx = \int_a^c f(x) \,dx  + \int_c^b f(x) \,dx $$
