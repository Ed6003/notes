# Embedded Systems & Security

## Embedded Systems

- Embedded software is software integrated with physical processes. The technical problem is managing time and concurrency in computational systems.
- Embedded processing is in everything, and will be in more things as computing becomes more ubiquitous
- Application areas include:
  - Automotive
    - ABS brakes
    - ESP - electronic stability control
    - Airbags
    - Automatic gearboxes
    - Smart keys
  - Avionics
    - Flight control
    - Anti-collision systems
    - Flap control
    - Entertainment systems
  - Consumer electronics
    - TVs
    - Smart Home
- Dependability is key
  - Reliability $R(t)$ is the probability of a system working correctly, provided it was working at $t=0$
  - Maintainability $M(d)$ is the probability of a system working correctly $d$ time units after an error occured
  - Availability $A(t)$ is the probability of a system working at time $t$
  - Safety - no harm must be caused
  - Security - data and communication must be confidential and authenticated
- Embedded systems bust be efficient:
  - Code-size efficient (especially for SoCs)
  - Runtime efficient
  - Weight and size efficient (small)
  - Cost and energy efficient
    - Power is the most important constraint in embedded systems
- General purpose processors are CPUs like we're used to
  - Application specific have all the same components but are more optimised with custom hardware
  - Single-purpose processors have very limited resources and are constrained to run a single program
- Different types of hardware:
  - ASICs - Application Specific Integrated Circuits
    - Custom designed circuits on chips
    - Necessary if ultimate speed or efficiency is the goal
    - Can only be produced in volume
      - Masks to produce are hugely expensive
    - Suffers from lack of flexibility, long design times and high costs
    - Power consumption scales with voltage quadratically
    - Can do dynamic power management
    - Varying clock speed can save energy
  - FPGAs - Field Programmable Gate Arrays
    - hahaha
  - DSPs - Digital Signal Processors
  - MPUs - Microprocessor Units
- Minimising power consumption is important for
  - Design of power supply
  - Design of voltage regulators
  - Dimensioning of interconnect
  - Cooling - high cost and limited space
  - Energy availability often restricted (battery powered)
  - Lower temperatures lead to longer lifetimes
- Efficiency also a concern in memory
  - Speed, must have predictable timing
  - Energy efficiency
  - Size
  - Cost
  - Energy usage and access time increases with size
- Scratch pad memory is a small separate memory mapped intro address space
  - Selection done through a simple address decoder
  - Used as it is far more energy efficient than a cache
